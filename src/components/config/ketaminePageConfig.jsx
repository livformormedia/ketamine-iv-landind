    {
      question: "Is At-Home Ketamine Microdosing Safe?",
      answer: "When done with medical direction, at-home ketamine microdosing can be safe and effective. At Ketamine of Central Georgia, every treatment plan is carefully tailored and overseen by experienced professionals. We conduct thorough evaluations to ensure you're a good candidate, and we provide clear guidance, ongoing support, and access to clinical expertise throughout the program. Because the doses are sub-perceptual (meaning you won't feel intoxicated or impaired), they are designed to fit safely into your daily routine without disrupting your ability to function. Safety, effectiveness, and your well-being are our top priorities at every step."
    },
    {
      question: "How Is Your At-Home Ketamine Therapy Different from Your In-Office IV Therapy?",
      answer: "Both treatments support mental health but differ in delivery, experience, intensity, and investment:\n\nDelivery - In-office: IV ketamine at higher doses intended to induce perceptual changes. At-home: Sublingual microdoses (under the tongue or intranasal), taken regularly at home.\n\nExperience - In-office: Deep, immersive sessions with medical monitoring. At-home: Gentle, consistent neural rewiring seamlessly integrated into daily life.\n\nIntensity & Goals - In-office: Ideal for rapid relief of acute dysphoria, anxiety and suicidal ideation. At-home: Utilizes cognitive flexibility to build long-term emotional balance, resilience and mood improvement.\n\nSupport - Both include expert guidance—clinic-based care offers real-time monitoring, while at-home care adds privacy and flexibility.\n\nEvidence & Investment - IV infusions have the most scientific backing to date, but at-home microdosing is quickly becoming a close second. At-home treatment is also significantly more affordable—often less than $8.50/day—making transformative care more accessible.\n\nChoosing What's Right for You - We'll help you select the approach that best fits your needs, goals, and lifestyle."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need a referral?",
      answer: "No referral is necessary. Simply complete the qualifying introductory form to schedule a consultation with our medical team to determine if this treatment is right for you."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does treatment take each day?",
      answer: "Taking your daily medication is quick and simple - no special preparation or time commitment required and precise instructions will arrive with your medication from our partner compounding pharmacy."
    },
    {
      question: "How quickly will I notice results?",
      answer: "The majority of patients report gradual symptom improvement over the course of the 3-month protocol. Daily administration facilitates neuroplastic changes and mood regulation through consistent, low-dose neural exposure to ketamine."
    },
    {
      question: "What does the three month program include?",
      answer: "Our comprehensive program includes all prescribed medication, progress tracking through our app, monthly consultations with our provider, and ongoing support via phone, text, and email."
    },
    {
      question: "Will I need treatment beyond the initial 3-month program?",
      answer: "For many patients, the initial three-month microdosing protocol provides lasting symptom relief and a meaningful improvement in quality of life. It often serves as a reset point—a launchpad into a new version of yourself, with a higher emotional baseline and greater psychological resilience. For individuals with more severe or complex conditions, one to two additional months of continued treatment may be recommended. Integrating medication with our experienced therapist during the course of treatment has been shown to further enhance outcomes by helping you process insights and reinforce positive change. Dr. Greenberg will closely monitor your progress and work with you to determine the treatment duration that best supports your long-term well-being."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you accept insurance?",
      answer: "We are not in-network with any insurance providers and therefore cannot bill insurance directly. However, we can provide superbills for patients who wish to submit claims for potential out-of-network reimbursement."
